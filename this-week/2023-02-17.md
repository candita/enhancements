  `priority/important-soon, jira/valid-reference`

  > This enhancement proposes the addition of supportability tooling to MicroShift.
  >
  > To debug issues in the cluster we need a single command that any user or
  > administrator is able to run to gather all the required information to diagnose
  > and solve problems.

- [1312](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1312): (4/88) microshift: USHIFT-734: MicroShift Upgrade and Rollback (oglok) ([USHIFT-518](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/USHIFT-518))

  `priority/important-soon`

  > Allow successful upgrades of MicroShift running on Edge Devices and enable
  > the ability of going back to a previous working state. To support this process,
  > MicroShift relies on the transactional features of OSTree by atomically
  > switching between states.

There were 7 Other New pull requests:

- [1346](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1346): (10/10) kube-apiserver: Introduce detection of stale clusteroperator conditions (deads2k)

  > In OpenShift 4, every active operator included in the core payload (cluster operator) updates its conditions in "
  > clusteroperator" resource. Conditions determine whether specific core components are Degraded or Available or if they
  > are making progress or if their state causes the cluster to be not upgradeable. These conditions are essential for
  > cluster administrators to determine the health of their clusters, and they are usually the first thing Red Hat support
  > is going to look at in case there is a problem with the cluster.
  >
  > Unfortunately, in some edge cases, these conditions might not reflect the current state of the cluster. For example,
  > since they depend on the running operator, these conditions might become stale and outdated if the operator is not
  > running or cannot contact the API server. And while the API server might still work, the result
  > of `oc get clusteroperators` does not represent the cluster's current state.
  >
  > Therefore, we need a detection mechanism to help detect in-active operators or operators that are not actively updating
  > the conditions.

- [1350](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1350): (34/34) microshift: ETCD-391: Adding Microshift enhancement for defragementation of etcd (dusk125) ([ETCD-391](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/ETCD-391))

  `jira/valid-reference`

  > This enhancement proposes adding a control loop to automatically and periodically run the etcd defragment commands.

- [1352](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1352): (4/4) agent-installer: AGENT-547: Propose host-based mirror for agent-based installer (bfournie) ([AGENT-262](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/AGENT-262))

  `jira/valid-reference`

  > The agent based installer should have the ability to include all container
  > images needed to boot a host in a disconnected environment, along with
  > necessary tools, when it generates an ISO. This will allow the hosts to boot
  > without an external mirror registry residing on a separate server.

- [1353](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1353): (3/3) cloud-integration: Update `External` platform type EP with implementation histotry block (lobziik) ([OCPPLAN-9429](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPPLAN-9429)) ([OCPPLAN-8156](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPPLAN-8156))

  > In an effort to reduce the amount of time Red Hat engineers spend directly involved with third party engagements,
  > adding new platforms into the OpenShift product, this enhancement describes how we will add a new `External`
  > platform type that will allow third parties to self-serve and integrate with OpenShift without the need to modify
  > any core payload components and without the need for direct involvement of OpenShift engineers.
