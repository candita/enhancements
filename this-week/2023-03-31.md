## Enhancements for Release Priorities

### Prioritized Active Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 2 Prioritized Active pull requests:

- [1312](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1312): (1/106) microshift: USHIFT-734: MicroShift Upgrade and Rollback (oglok) ([USHIFT-518](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/USHIFT-518))

  `lifecycle/rotten, priority/important-soon`

  > Allow successful upgrades of MicroShift running on Edge Devices and enable
  > the ability of going back to a previous working state. To support this process,
  > MicroShift relies on the transactional features of OSTree by atomically
  > switching between states.

- [1304](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1304): (1/263) microshift: USHIFT-599 Make MicroShift core components pluggable (mangelajo) ([USHIFT-599](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/USHIFT-599))

  `lifecycle/rotten, priority/important-soon`

  > This enhancement proposes making some of the core components like CNI and CSI
  > optional and pluggable.
  >
  > In the enhancement proposal we will describe an architecture which would allow
  > customers to install individual components as rpm packages, as well as some
  > alternative implementations.


## Other Enhancements

### Other Merged Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 2 Other Merged pull requests:

- [1279](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1279): (2/279) insights: on demand Insights data gathering (tremes) ([CCXDEV-8854](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CCXDEV-8854)) ([CCX-195](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CCX-195)) ([CCXDEV-9980](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CCXDEV-9980))

  > The Insights operator periodically gathers cluster data and sends it to Red Hat. The data is analyzed and the corresponding Insights analysis result is provided to the cluster. The OpenShift user can then see the number of active recommendations and go to the Insights advisor for
  > more information. Right now, there is no way for a user to run Insights data gathering on demand - e.g when some of the Insights recommendations have been resolved.

- [1310](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1310): (4/51) agent-installer: AGENT-436: Propose interactive network config for agent-based installer (zaneb) ([AGENT-385](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/AGENT-385))

  > Enable the user, after booting the agent ISO, to interactively add or correct
  > any neccessary network configuration. Since we cannot rely on network
  > connectivity for this step, configuration will be via a text user interface
  > (TUI) displayed on the console.


### Other New Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 3 Other New pull requests:

- [1372](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1372): (19/19) windows-containers: WINC-1007: Windows CSI Proxy enhancement proposal (sebsoto)

  `jira/valid-reference`

  > This goal of this enhancement is to enable the use persistent storage for Windows workloads, without the use of in-tree
  > storage drivers, [which are in the process of being deprecated and removed.](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/09/26/storage-in-tree-to-csi-migration-status-update-1.25/)
  >
  > This will be done by running [CSI Proxy](https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/csi-proxy) as a Windows service on each
  > Windows node. csi-proxy is a pre-requisite for CSI node driver pods to interact with the underlying Windows storage
  > APIs. With csi-proxy running on a cluster's Windows nodes, cluster administrators are free to deploy the CSI storage
  > drivers of their choice as a Windows DaemonSet, enabling Windows pods on each node to have access to storage through
  > PersistentVolumeClaims.

- [1373](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1373): (13/13) dev-guide: new approach to featuregates for coordination in the cluster (deads2k)

  > This enhancement aims to reduce the effort required to add a feature gate to TechPreviewNoUpgrade and to promote
  > that feature gate to Default.
  > Feature gates in OpenShift are enabled and disabled in a particular FeatureSet, mixing and matching is not allowed.
  > Prior to this enhancement, it is necessary to vendor openshift/api into every impacted repository.
  > After this enhancement, it will only be necessary to vendor into cluster-config-operator.

- [1374](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1374): (11/11) cluster-logging: API-server audit log filtering policy in ClusterLogForwarder (alanconway)

  > The Kube and Openshift API servers generate a lot of log data, with very large individual records.
  > Much of this data has little or no value for security auditing.
  > It is not feasible to forward the unfiltered data to most external log storage systems.
  > Audit events may exceed record size limits, and the total volume may be too expensive to store.
  >
  > Kubernetes defines an [audit policy configuration][k8s-auditing] to filter audit events,
  > Service Delivery uses  this configuration internally for managed clusters.
  >
  > The goals of this proposal are:
  > - Make the Kubernetes audit policy available for customer log forwarding.
  > - Allow customers and Service Delivery to configure _independent_ policies and destinations for audit logs.
  >
