## Enhancements for Release Priorities

### Prioritized Merged Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 2 Prioritized Merged pull requests:

- [1316](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1316): (62/95) microshift: NP-604: Add MicroShift Service of Loadbalancer Type Support (pliurh) ([NP-604](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NP-604))

  > Customers using loadbalancer type Service don't want to make changes to their
  > workloads/deployment for MicroShift as they use other k8s flavors as well. It is
  > also promised by us that users can create workload manifests that can work on
  > both OpenShift and MicroShift (as long as they do not use APIs unsupported by
  > MicroShift).

- [1318](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1318): (39/301) microshift: USHIFT-759: MicroShift Supportability Enhancement (pacevedom) ([USHIFT-389](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/USHIFT-389))

  > This enhancement proposes the addition of supportability tooling to MicroShift.
  >
  > To debug issues in the cluster we need a single command that any user or
  > administrator is able to run to gather all the required information to diagnose
  > and solve problems.


### Prioritized Active Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 3 Prioritized Active pull requests:

- [1350](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1350): (22/56) microshift: ETCD-391: Adding Microshift enhancement for defragementation of etcd (dusk125) ([ETCD-391](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/ETCD-391))

  `priority/important-soon, jira/valid-reference`

  > This enhancement proposes adding a control loop to automatically and periodically run the etcd defragment commands.

- [1312](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1312): (16/104) microshift: USHIFT-734: MicroShift Upgrade and Rollback (oglok) ([USHIFT-518](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/USHIFT-518))

  `priority/important-soon`

  > Allow successful upgrades of MicroShift running on Edge Devices and enable
  > the ability of going back to a previous working state. To support this process,
  > MicroShift relies on the transactional features of OSTree by atomically
  > switching between states.

- [1304](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1304): (2/261) microshift: USHIFT-599 Make MicroShift core components pluggable (mangelajo) ([USHIFT-599](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/USHIFT-599))

  `priority/important-soon`

  > This enhancement proposes making some of the core components like CNI and CSI
  > optional and pluggable.
  >
  > In the enhancement proposal we will describe an architecture which would allow
  > customers to install individual components as rpm packages, as well as some
  > alternative implementations.


## Other Enhancements

### Other Merged Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 4 Other Merged pull requests:

- [1327](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1327): (3/37) baremetal: Enable CBO on AWS platform (elfosardo) ([METAL-300](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/METAL-300))

  > Baremetal Host API is available when deploying an OpenShift cluster with the baremetal platform (via the IPI or AI (Assisted Installer) workflow) or with the on-premise platforms Openstack, vSphere, and None.
  > Adding the possibility to deploy and manage bare metal hosts from clusters not in an on-premise infrastructure would be beneficial to customers.

### Other New Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 6 Other New pull requests:

- [1356](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1356): (37/37) microshift: ETCD-356: Adding Microshift enhancement for selecting etcd dir alignment approach (dusk125) ([ETCD-356](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/ETCD-356))

  `jira/valid-reference`

  > In Openshift, etcd and related tools (like etcdctl and sos) rely on the directories `/var/lib/etcd`, `/etc/kubernetes/static-pod-certs`, `/etc/kubenetes/static-pod-resources` to exist and to contain relevant files by default. In Microshift, all of the Microshift related information (including etcd) is located under `/var/lib/microshift` (with the etcd data directory
  > `/var/lib/microshift/etcd`).

- [1357](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1357): (15/15) general: BPF Support for OCP with bpfd (anfredette)

  `ok-to-test`

  > This enhancement proposes the following:
  > - That the bpfd operator be included in OCP as a foundational operator.
  > - That the bpfd operator be used by internal Red Hat OCP applications and
  >   components for the loading and management of required BPF programs.
  > - That bpfd be recommended and supported for use by OCP partners and users to
  >   load and manage their BPF programs when running on OCP.

- [1360](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1360): (72/72) windows-containers: WINC-939: Windows Node Global Egress Proxy Support (saifshaikh48)

  `do-not-merge/work-in-progress, jira/valid-reference`

  > The goal of this enhancement proposal is to allow Windows nodes to consume and use global egress proxy configuration
  > when making external requests outside the cluster's internal network. OpenShift customers may require that external
  > traffic is passed through a proxy for security reasons, and Windows instances are no exception. There already exists a
  > protocol for publishing [cluster-wide proxy](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.12/networking/enable-cluster-wide-proxy.html)
  > settings, which is consumed by different OpenShift components (Linux worker nodes and infra nodes, CVO and OLM managed
  > operators) but Windows worker nodes do not currently consume or respect proxy settings. This effort will work to plug
  > feature disparity by making the [Windows Machine Config Operator](https://github.com/openshift/windows-machine-config-operator)
  > (WMCO) proxy aware at install time and reactive during runtime.

- [1361](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1361): (8/8) microshift: ETCD-356: Supportability of etcd in MicroShift (dhellmann) ([ETCD-356](https://issues.redhat.com//browse/ETCD-356))

  `jira/valid-reference`

  > This enhancement captures some decisions about how we will provide
  > support procedures and tools for etcd as it is configured and used in
  > MicroShift deployements.
