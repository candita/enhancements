## Enhancements for Release Priorities

### Prioritized Active Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 2 Prioritized Active pull requests:

- [1312](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1312): (1/105) microshift: USHIFT-734: MicroShift Upgrade and Rollback (oglok) ([USHIFT-518](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/USHIFT-518))

  `lifecycle/stale, priority/important-soon`

  > Allow successful upgrades of MicroShift running on Edge Devices and enable
  > the ability of going back to a previous working state. To support this process,
  > MicroShift relies on the transactional features of OSTree by atomically
  > switching between states.

- [1304](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1304): (1/262) microshift: USHIFT-599 Make MicroShift core components pluggable (mangelajo) ([USHIFT-599](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/USHIFT-599))

  `lifecycle/stale, priority/important-soon`

  > This enhancement proposes making some of the core components like CNI and CSI
  > optional and pluggable.
  >
  > In the enhancement proposal we will describe an architecture which would allow
  > customers to install individual components as rpm packages, as well as some
  > alternative implementations.


## Other Enhancements

### Other Merged Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 3 Other Merged pull requests:

- [1360](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1360): (4/146) windows-containers: WINC-939: Windows Node Global Egress Proxy Support (saifshaikh48) ([OCPBU-22](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBU-22)) ([WINC-802](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WINC-802))

  > The goal of this enhancement proposal is to allow Windows nodes to consume and use global egress proxy configuration
  > when making external requests outside the cluster's internal network. OpenShift customers may require that external
  > traffic is passed through a proxy for security reasons, and Windows instances are no exception. There already exists a
  > protocol for publishing [cluster-wide proxy](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.12/networking/enable-cluster-wide-proxy.html)
  > settings, which is consumed by different OpenShift components (Linux worker nodes and infra nodes, CVO and OLM managed
  > operators) but Windows worker nodes do not currently consume or respect proxy settings. This effort will work to plug
  > feature disparity by making the [Windows Machine Config Operator](https://github.com/openshift/windows-machine-config-operator)
  > (WMCO) aware of cluster proxy settings at install time and reactive during runtime.
